Access YouTube Channel statistics for channels and videos

A small program making it easier to retrieve, and collate, the team's statistics beginning with accessing YouTube statistics.

## Requirements

The first thing is to log on to the [Google Developer's Console](https://console.developers.google.com) and set up an API key.  Once created, use it to retrieve open (ie: no user specific) data related to the channel's stats that are retrieved.
