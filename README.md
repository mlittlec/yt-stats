Access YouTube Channel statistics for channels and videos

A small program making it easier to retrieve, and collate, the team's statistics beginning with accessing YouTube statistics.

## Requirements

Several prerequisites are required to be in place prior to attempting to execute these scripts.

- **Set up Google Developer API Key:** The first thing is to log on to the [Google Developer's Console](https://console.developers.google.com) and set up an API key.  Once created, use it to retrieve open (ie: no user specific) data related to the channel's stats that are retrieved.

- Install the **Google API Toolkit** into your Python environment: The details of the Python API are located [here](https://www.githib.com/googleapis/google-api-python-client).  Follow the Install steps appropriate for the Operaiting System you're using, as detailed on the main page.

- use the **Google API:** By looking at the [developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3) for video, or [here](https://develops.google.com/outube/v3/docs/channels)
